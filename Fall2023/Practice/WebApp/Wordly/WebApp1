Checking the javascript code, I can see it checks a list at the url: https://075f8a680393cf1dee8743f8624b4b7a-wordly.web.cityinthe.cloud/static/words.json

Navigating to this site gives the list all all possible 5 letter words that could be used in the game.

Scrolling to the bottom of the list, there are 2236 possible word choices. 

We can also see in Network that every request is met with a POST to https://075f8a680393cf1dee8743f8624b4b7a-wordly.web.cityinthe.cloud/check
This and the naming, we can assume that is probably how they verify what is correct.


I think the proper way to get the flag is to use a tool like Burpsuite Intruder to populate and check answers, most likely by matching the seeds. As the correct answer shifts every request.

I grabbed a random word from the list and submitted it enough times until random chance gave me the flag.
