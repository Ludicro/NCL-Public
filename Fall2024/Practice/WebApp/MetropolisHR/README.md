Reading Elyse's profile, she gives the name Molly as the person she reports to. Change the url to "Molly".

However, you get told you need admin credentials. Looking in the cookies, there is one called `level: user`. Change it to `level: admin` and refreshing, you will see the flag in Molly's profile.
