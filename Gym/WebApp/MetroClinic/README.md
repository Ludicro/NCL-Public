### Nothing again? This is getting ridiculous
Looking at the network data when we use as intended, we can see we are redirected to the page `/professionals.html?q=[userInput]`

Seeing the `?q=[Input]` let's us know that this website uses queries. Combined with the fact we're getitng tables, probably a SQL query. 

We can confirm this by passing in bad queries like `1"` and looking at the errors given.

---


# Exploiting
Now we can move onto the real exploit by looking at all the information we have determined.

---


## Information
- Site contains a database of employee information
- The site uses SQLite

---

## Using the Information
Since the only thing we can interact with on this page is a search bar that runs a SQL query based on our input, odds are we will be crafting a SQL injection. 

There are many ways to do this and is often a pain since we have to do this manually.

---

### Designing a SQL Injection

---

#### Breaking Out of the Query
A good place to start is attempting to break out of the currenty query. 

Most vulnerbale SQL queries (when searching for strings as we are) encase the query inside of either `"` or `'`. 

If we try making our search `1"` or `1'` we get two results. The `1"` gives us an error for a bad query, so we may be closer to the right track here. 

Next we can add a `;` as that ends statements in SQLLite. 

---

#### Crafting Advanced Injections
Now that we have broken out of the query by finishing it and starting a new line, we can try to get our information.

We will `SELECT` all fields `*` `FROM` a table `WHERE` any character (`%`) is `=` to any information in the table by leaving the statement open for the databse to process (ending in an `"`).

---

#### Final Query
Putting it all together results in a query that looks like.
```
1"; SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE "%"="
```
We use the `USERS` table as that is a common name.

We can query other information as well with queries like `1"; select sqlite_version();`

This is a good repo for example SQL injections: [swissky/PayloadsAllTheThings/SQL Injection](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL%20Injection)

---

## Result
Entering our designed query
```
1"; SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE "%"="
```
will reveal all the information in the database, including columns we couldn't previously see before.
